### What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
> This exercise introduced us to JavaScript basics. We were taught that JavaScript will be crucial for the rest of our exercises, and this specific exercise we have this week will be one of them. One of the features that I love in JavaScript (unlike in previous programming languages that we had) is the use of boolean values. Flagging statements has become easier with the built-in boolean features.
